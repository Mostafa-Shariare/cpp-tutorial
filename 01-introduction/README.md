# 🧾 01 – Introduction to C++

Welcome to your very first step into the world of **C++ programming**! 🎉  
In this lesson, you'll get a quick overview of what C++ is, where it’s used, and why learning it is a smart move.

---

## 🚀 What is C++?

C++ is a **general-purpose programming language** created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in the early 1980s. It’s an extension of the C programming language, with added support for **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features of C++

- ✅ **Compiled** and fast
- ✅ **Cross-platform**
- ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- ✅ **Low-level memory manipulation**
- ✅ **Standard Template Library (STL)**

---

## 💡 Where is C++ Used?

C++ is used in:
- 🕹 Game development (Unreal Engine, etc.)
- 💻 Operating systems (Windows, Linux kernels)
- 📱 Desktop applications
- 🚀 Embedded systems
- 📈 Competitive programming
- 🧠 High-performance systems (e.g. trading platforms, simulations)

---

## 🎯 Why Learn C++?

- Build **strong fundamentals**
- Improve your **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking**
- Learn concepts used in other languages (Java, C#, etc.)
- Great for **college courses** and **coding interviews**

## 🧪 Sample Program

Here’s your first C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
````

### 🔍 Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

> This is the basic structure of any C++ program — don’t worry, we’ll break it down in the upcoming lessons.

## ⏭️ What’s Next?

In the next lesson, we’ll dive into **variables**, how to declare them, and how they work in C++.
