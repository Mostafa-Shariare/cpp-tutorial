# C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains everything I learn about **C++ programming**. It is my personal knowledge hub where I’ll keep notes, code examples, and problem-solving attempts while learning step by step.

---

## 📌 Purpose

* To track my C++ learning journey.
* To keep all topics organized in one place.
* To build a resource I can revisit anytime.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repo will gradually be organized into folders like:

* **Basics/** → Starting point (syntax, variables, loops).
* **Functions/** → Functions, recursion, parameter passing.
* **OOP/** → Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
* **STL/** → Vectors, maps, sets, algorithms.
* **DSA/** → Problem-solving using C++.
* **Projects/** → Mini and major C++ projects.
* **Notes/** → Key points and references.

*(For now, only starting topics will be added — more will come as I learn.)*

---

## 🛠️ Topics That Will Be Covered

Since this repo is just starting, the following topics will **be covered gradually**:

* Basics of C++ (history, syntax, variables, operators, loops).
* Functions and recursion.
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
* Standard Template Library (STL).
* File handling.
* Data Structures and Algorithms with C++.
* Modern C++ features.
